## Frontend E-Commerce Website
This is a fully responsive frontend e-commerce web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project replicates the core functionality of a modern fashion shopping platform with structured navigation, real-time filtering, and interactive UI components — all without backend integration.
